Instructions: In your Airtable automation (When record created in "New App Logins" → Send to Slack), replace each [Field Name] with the automation's insert field / variable for that column (e.g. use the field picker and select the matching Airtable field). Use only the lines you want in Slack; omit Email, Session ID, or Metadata if you prefer a shorter message.
