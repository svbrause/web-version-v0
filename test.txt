i think the navigation is confusing and unclear. the first few steps make sense where you start, you select your interests, and you can review the three concerns that you selected. however, past that point, i think the flow is unclear. i think the lack of clarity stems from there being multiple layers past the selection screen where you select which screen to review. lets say you click on how to resolve forehead wrinkles. then on the subsequent page, i can learn about forehead wrinkles from the text at the top or i can go into any number of the cases. then i can go into and out of cases to my heart's desire. then i can go out two layers and let's say review how to resolve glabella wrinkles. i think the problem stems from mme not understanding what is the goal that we are trying to achieve as a patient. i understand the overall high-level goal of wanting to learn about these treatments and issues to address, but i dont know that it is abundantly clear how to accomplish this in the ui. i think much of the information is there but it feels a bit repetitive and has more clicking around than i think would be optimal for a streamlined user experience. basiecally we want users to come un, say what they are interested, then as soon as possible get excited about something related to their interests and therefore book a consultation with the provider. i think the current experience has much indirection and bloat and such that i think detracts from how streamlined the experience should be. is this concern clear to you? can you make some suggestions around how to address this?
