      "treatmentDetails": "Addressing jawline definition required a thoughtful, customized strategy. Autologous fat grafting was performed, harvesting fat cells from a donor site using gentle liposuction, then purifying and concentrating them before micro-injection along the mandibular border. This living tissue transfer provides natural-looking, long-lasting volume restoration using the patient's own cells. The fat was placed in tiny droplets across multiple planes to maximize survival rate and create smooth, natural contours. Results improve over 3-6 months as the transferred fat integrates and stabilizes. The treatment was personalized after thorough assessment of proportions and aesthetics. The treatment was well-tolerated, with most patients comparing it to mild pressure. The result is a noticeably sharper, more defined jawline that photographs beautifully from every angle. Results were with collagen remodeling ongoing for months."
